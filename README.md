# postgresql-component [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/elasticio/postgresql-component.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/elasticio/postgresql-component) [![Dependency Status][daviddm-image]][daviddm-url]

> PostgreSQL component for the [elastic.io platform](http://www.elastic.io) that also works well with AWS Redshift

This is an open source component template for working with [PostgreSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostgreSQL) object-relational database management system on [elastic.io platform](http://www.elastic.io "elastic.io platform"). You can clone it and change it as you wish. However, **if you plan to deploy it into [elastic.io platform](http://www.elastic.io "elastic.io platform") you must follow sets of instructions to succeed**.

## Before you Begin

Before you can deploy any code into elastic.io **you must be a registered elastic.io platform user**. Please see our home page at [http://www.elastic.io](http://www.elastic.io) to learn how.

We'll use git and SSH public key authentication to upload your component code, therefore you must **[upload your SSH Key](http://docs.elastic.io/docs/ssh-key)**.

> If you fail to upload you SSH Key you will get **permission denied** error during the deployment.

## Pushing this component in your environment

After registration and uploading of your SSH Key you can proceed to deploy it into our system. At this stage we suggest you to:
* [Create a team](http://docs.elastic.io/page/team-management) to work on your new component. This is not required but will be automatically created using random naming by our system so we suggest you name your team accordingly.
* [Create a repository](http://docs.elastic.io/page/repository-management) where your new component is going to *reside* inside the team that you have just created.

Now as you have a team name and component repository name you can add a new git remote where code shall be pushed to. It is usually displayed on the empty repository page:

```bash
$ git remote add elasticio your-team@git.elastic.io:your-repository.git
```

Obviously the naming of your team and repository is entirely up-to you and if you do not put any corresponding naming our system will auto generate it for you but the naming might not entirely correspond to your project requirements.

Now we are ready to push it:

```bash
$ git push elasticio master
```

# What's inside

With this component you will have following trigger:
 * SELECT - this trigger will execute an SQL query that returns multiple results, it has no limitations on the query but apparently best suited for SELECT type of queries

Following acitons are inside:
 * SELECT - same as above but as an action
 * INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE - this action executes the SQL query that returns no data, for example insert, delete or update. After query is executed original message will be pushed to the next component.

## How SQL templates work

# Known limitations

There are several limitations of the component:

1. No transaction support
1. We are relying on standard type default js<->postgresql data-type coercion [see here](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres#features)

If in doubt call support.
